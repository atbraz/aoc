    This function reads the complete contents of a file at the given path

    endings, making it suitable for processing that requires preserving
    the exact file structure.

    # Arguments
    * `path` - Any type that can be converted into a Path

    # Returns
    A String containing the entire contents of the file if successful

    # Errors
    This function will return an error if:
    * The file does not exist
    * The process lacks permissions to read the file
    * The file content is not valid UTF-8
    * The file is empty

    # Examples

    # Arguments
    * `path` - Any type that can be converted into a Path

    # Returns
    A vector of Strings, where each String is a line from the file

    # Errors
    This function will return an error if:
    * The file cannot be opened (doesn't exist or insufficient permissions)
    * Any line in the file contains invalid UTF-8
    * The file is empty
    * IO operations fail while reading the file

    /**
    Reads a file into a single continuous string by removing all newlines

    This function is useful when working with data that is split across multiple
    lines purely for readability but should logically be treated as one continuous
    string. For example, if your input looks like:
    ```text
    ABCDEF
    GHIJKL
    MNOPQR
    ```
    It will return "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQR" as a single string.

    Unlike `as_string`, which preserves newlines, this function specifically
    removes all line breaks to create a single continuous string. This is
    particularly useful for Advent of Code problems involving long sequences
    that happen to be formatted across multiple lines.

    # Arguments
    * `path` - Any type that can be converted into a Path

    # Returns
    A single String with all newlines removed from the file content

    # Errors
    This function will return an error if:
    * The file cannot be opened (doesn't exist or insufficient permissions)
    * The file contains invalid UTF-8 characters
    * The file is completely empty
    * IO operations fail while reading the file

    # Examples
    ```no_run
    use your_crate::InputReader;

    let content = InputReader::as_single_line("input.txt").unwrap();
    // Now we have a single continuous string to work with
    println!("Total length: {}", content.len());

    // Useful for problems involving long sequences
    if content.contains("AABB") {
        println!("Found pattern AABB in the sequence!");
    }
    ```

    # Examples

    use aoc_common_rust::input::InputReader;

    /**
    Reads a file and splits it into paragraphs, where paragraphs are groups of
    non-empty lines separated by blank lines

    This function is particularly useful for Advent of Code problems where input
    data comes in groups separated by empty lines. For example, if your input
    looks like:
    ```text
    1234
    5678

    abcd
    efgh
    ijkl
    ```
    It will return a vector containing two strings: "1234\n5678" and "abcd\nefgh\nijkl"

    # Arguments
    * `path` - Any type that can be converted into a Path

    # Returns
    A vector of Strings, where each String represents a paragraph with its
    internal line breaks preserved

    # Errors
    This function will return an error if:
    * The file cannot be opened (doesn't exist or insufficient permissions)
    * The file contains invalid UTF-8 characters
    * The file is completely empty
    * IO operations fail while reading the file

    # Examples
    ```no_run
